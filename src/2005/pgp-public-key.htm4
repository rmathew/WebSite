<p>
I now have <a href="m4_root_dir/aa_6C114B8F.txt">my own PGP Public Key</a> (Key Identifier: <tt>6C114B8F</tt>, Key Fingerprint: <tt>D6E5 B9C2 5522 ED3D 09DC 3B40 61BD 61C7 6C11 4B8F</tt>) that I will try to use with my email messages. Of course, this will not work with the web interfaces provided by Gmail and Hotmail, but it works nicely with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> using the <a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org/">Enigmail</a> extension. I have published this key to a couple of keyservers. I do not foresee being able to participate in a Free Software hackers' key-signing party any time soon, but I have signed the keys from Mark Wielaard, Michael Koch and Andrew Haley for whatever it is worth.

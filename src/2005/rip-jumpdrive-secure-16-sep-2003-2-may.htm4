After <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/rmathew/diary/8.html">over 1.5 years of continuous service</a>, my JumpDrive Secure 256MB USB drive has gone dead after I dropped it on hard floor in a moment of unpardonable carelessness yesterday. It was a good buy and it was <i>tremendously</i> useful. On Lexar's site for the JumpDrive Secure, there are incredible testimonials of this drive having survived various ordeals, including being washed with a person's laundry, and emerging unscathed. Alas, no such luck for me!  I even tried to pry it open and see if there was an obviously loose component anywhere that I could set right, but it's literally a couple of chips soldered onto a small PCB connected to a USB plug. As with almost all purely electronic devices, I cannot do anything here. This is rather unlike mechanical or simple electrical devices where I usually can figure out the problem and sometimes rectify the problem.

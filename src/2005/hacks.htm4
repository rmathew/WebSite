Yumpee pointed me to an <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,63744,00.html">old story</a> about a guy who used a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro">BBC Micro</a> monitoring a decaying prawn sandwich to tell the time!  <a href="http://home.gna.org/jockey/">Jockey</a> is a cool user-space program execution recording and replaying library for Linux. It actually <a href="http://home.gna.org/jockey/doc/segregation-stack.html">scans</a> the code page of a process to recognise system call instructions and rewrites them to jump to a trampoline instead.   By the way, my favourite Free 3D modelling tool <a href="http://www.blender3d.com/">Blender</a> has <a href="http://www.blender3d.com/cms/Blender_2_40.598.0.html">reached version 2.40</a> featuring tonnes of cool improvements.

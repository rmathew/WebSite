<a href="http://gnu.wildebeest.org/diary/index.php?p=60">Mark</a>: Honeymoon? Congratulations!  As for <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/evince/">Evince</a>, my PC only has KDE and therefore I don't think I can use it. In any case, I like the way Adobe Acrobat Reader cleanly renders PDFs and I especially like the navigation and zoom controls. The last I checked, both XPDF and KPDF were rather lacking in this area.

<p>
Addison Wesley have put up <a href="http://wps.aw.com/aw_aho_compilers_2/0,11227,2663889-,00.html">a sneak preview</a> of what is in the long overdue and much anticipated updated edition of The Dragon Book (a.k.a. "Compilers: Principles, Tools and Techniques" by Aho, Ullman and Sethi). For some insane reason, they have decided to use JavaScript, Flash and pop-ups to show these chapters, prompting instant revulsion in yours truly. I'd rather wait for the dead-tree edition than subject myself to such torture.

<p>
Here are some random projects for GCJ of varying complexity that I would personally like to see implemented as soon as possible: <ul><li> Generics - Although Ken Arnold says <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/arnold/archive/2005/06/generics_consid_1.html">generics are a mistake</a>, they are still very useful in my personal opinion and GCJ should be able to handle them. Of course, it would mean fixing <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9861">PR9861</a> first. </li><li> Assembler - a Java assembler is a very useful tool to have, especially when you want to create invalid class files to test bytecode verification. We should either get <a href="http://jasmin.sourceforge.net/">Jasmin</a> integrated into Classpath Tools, or create one ourselves. The latter option would be eased if we could get <a href="http://asm.objectweb.org/">ASM</a> integrated into Classpath Tools via Archit Shah's work on a new RMI compiler  (which is still waiting to be checked in for some reason). </li><li> JIT Interpreter - I think QEMU's portable dynamic translation is a really nifty idea and it seems to work rather well judging by the speed at which QEMU emulates a guest operating system. This can perhaps be used by <tt>gij</tt> to implement a "real" JIT.  </li></ul>

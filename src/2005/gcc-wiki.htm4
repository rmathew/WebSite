Daniel Berlin's GCC Wiki is now officially <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/">hosted</a> on GCC's web site. As soon as I came to know of it, I vandalised it with <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GCJ">a stub article for GCJ</a>. Others will hopefully add more material to it and make it actually usable by GCJ newbies.

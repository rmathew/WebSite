I had configured and built GCC 3.4.4 with "<tt>--with-arch=pentium3</tt>" and was happily using it for everything till I decided to compile glibc 2.3.5 with it. The build failed with a weird assembler error message as noted in glibc <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=701">bug-701</a>. That bug however, had been been closed unceremoniously and marked a duplicate of <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=333">bug-333</a>, which itself looks unnecessarily obnoxious.  After a bit of poking around, I found out that GCC pre-defines "<tt>__i686</tt>" if "<tt>-march=pentium3</tt>" is used (see <tt>$GCC_SRC_DIR/gcc/config/i386/i386.h</tt>) and this was causing the problem with glibc (see <tt>$GLIBC_SRC_DIR/sysdeps/i386/elf/setjmp.S</tt>). So I had to explicitly use "<tt>-march=i386</tt>" with GCC to be able to compile glibc. However, "<tt>make check</tt>" still fails. I will now build and install a vanilla GCC 3.4.4 and see if that is able to properly build glibc.   By the way, glibc 2.3.5 can not be built with GCC 4.0.1, though <a href="http://kegel.com/">Dan Kegel</a> seems to have <a href="http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/crosstool-0.37/patches/glibc-2.3.5/">patches</a> to enable you to do it. It can not be built with anything lower than GCC 3.2 either.

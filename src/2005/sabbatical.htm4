<a href="http://vikgup.blogspot.com/2005/08/lets-get-serious.html">VikGup takes a sabbatical</a> for three months starting next week. I really envy him and I wish I could do the same.  Sabbaticals might be quite common in the west, but here in India they are very rare. Even when people want to take sabbaticals, many a time they are discouraged. I hope more people take off on sabbaticals like VikGup has done so that employers and family realise that it is OK, and actually quite healthy, to take a sabbatical.   Have fun VikGup!

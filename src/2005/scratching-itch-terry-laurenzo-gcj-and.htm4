<p>
One of the stumbling blocks in supporting generics in native programs created by GCJ is the fact that the C++ method-name-mangling used by GCJ does not encode the return type of the method and thus cannot support the Java 1.5 kludge for implementing generics (<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9861">PR9861</a>).  Terry was just another bloke who was trying to make his program work with GCJ when he hit this issue. Unlike most other blokes however, <a href="http://tjlaurenzo.blogspot.com/2005/08/adventures-with-java-5-and-gcj.html">he has decided to do something about it</a>. Cool!

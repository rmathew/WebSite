Returning from my vacation (<a href="http://www.goatourism.org/">Goa</a>!), I found that my Hotmail account was thankfully still there despite the deluge of spam that it was being subjected to in the last couple of weeks. Of course, it had exceeded its quota quite early on, so even some genuine messages must have bounced.  Nokia mobile phone users might find <a href="http://www.nokiainfo.net/info/nokia-secrets.php">this information</a> useful.  glibc 2.3.4 was finally <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-announce/2005/msg00000.html">released </a> yesterday. Time to mess with my machine's happiness. <tt>;-)</tt>

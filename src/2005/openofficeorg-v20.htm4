I have been waiting for this release for quite some time now, so as soon as it came out, I downloaded the Linux tarball. To my horror, I find that unlike previous releases it does not contain a simple installer but <i>many</i> RPMs! Why did they have to do this? It is so silly. An alternative for me is to build it from sources, but I do not have the energy or the enthusiasm to do it. Sheesh!

Some kind soul has helped the Harmony mailing list be available on <a href="http://news.gmane.org/">Gmane</a> as the newsgroup <tt>"gmane.comp.java.harmony.devel"</tt>. Thank you!  As was also observed by someone else, I find it rather amusing, and sad, that several years of effort on GCJ, Kaffe and Classpath did not seem to generate as much buzz as a single announcement of an <i>intention</i> by the ASF to create a J2SE 5 implementation.

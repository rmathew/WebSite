The first time I read or heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Sudoku</a> puzzles was in <a href="http://www.economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3992476">an article in The Economist</a>. A little over a fortnight later, The Times of India's Bangalore edition started publishing regular Sudoku puzzles of moderate difficulty and I have been hooked to them ever since. For those who can't get enough of them, there is also a GPL-ed <a href="http://sudoku.sourceforge.net/">Sudoku solver and generator</a>.

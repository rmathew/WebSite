This is much better than "the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog", which was the only other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram">pangram</a> I had known before seeing <a href="http://keithp.com/blogs/amateur_typographer/">this blog entry</a> by X guru Keith Packard. Talking of X, XFree86 released their server version 4.5.0 almost a week ago and I haven't seen references to it on any of the main nerds news sites yet. From the same blog entry by Keith, I came to know that a font designed <i>530 years</i> ago still looks quite decent.

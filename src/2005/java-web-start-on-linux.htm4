Due to a bug in Sun's Java Web Start executable in JDK 1.4.2_07 for Linux, I am not able to use it as-is on a system with glibc 2.3.4 and kernel 2.6.11. As should be obvious, if they had made it truly Free, I could have easily fixed the problem and moved on with my life. Since it is not, I have to either use an alternative like <a href="http://openjnlp.sourceforge.net/">OpenJNLP</a> or somehow work around this bug.  On a system where this bug does not manifest itself, I used "<tt>ps --columns 2000 -e -o "%a" | grep javaws</tt>" to grab the command line that is used by this executable to spawn the Java VM. I tried modifying this command line for my system (adjusting paths) and running it but it failed trying to download the JVM from Sun's site. After a bit of snooping around, I found out that it was looking for a file named "<tt>deployment.properties</tt>" in "<tt>$HOME/.java/.deployment</tt>" that is populated by the wrapper executable with the information on the JRE being used. So I just copied this file over from the system where stuff works and adjusted the paths. It finally worked as expected, albeit without the splash screen (which I do not regret losing at all).

Among the financial institutions I deal with and whose online facilities I use regularly, <a href="http://www.citibank.co.in/">Citibank India</a>, <a href="http://www.hdfcbank.com/">HDFC Bank</a> and <a href="http://www.icicibank.com/">ICICI Bank</a> have had great support for Firefox. The only exception was <a href="http://www.standardchartered.com/in/">Standard Chartered India</a> who did not seem to want to support anything other than IE or Netscape Communicator 4. I had pointed this out to their Customer Service several times and even pointed out where in their JavaScript code they were making the mistake, but I was always presented with a verbose, albeit nicely written, message asking me to just use the supported browsers and stop ranting. Needless to say, I was irritated and frustrated.  To my pleasant surprise, I discovered last week that they had silently started supporting Firefox as well. Perhaps it came about because a lot of their developers themselves use Firefox; perhaps a lot of customers actually complained; perhaps they saw that by most accounts, Firefox has around 8-10% of the "browser marketshare". Whatever be the reason, I am happy. It is also heartening to note that a lot of sites these days increasingly seem to just work with Firefox instead of requiring IE.

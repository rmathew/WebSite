The announcement of the Harmony project which aims to create a Free reimplementation of J2SE 5 under the umbrella of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) seems weird to a lot of people (including yours truly). The initial FAQ does not help much either.  My personal opinion is that if you need Free (as in liberty) Java you have either <a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe</a> or <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/java/">GCJ</a> depending on whether you prefer the traditional Java execution model or ahead-of-time compilation, respectively, not to mention many other VMs. Both depend on <a href="http://www.classpath.org/">GNU Classpath</a> to provide an implementation of the humongous and unwieldy "core" Java runtime class libraries. Without any elaboration, the "<i>All of these efforts provide a diversity of solutions, which is healthy, but barriers exist which prevent these efforts from reaching a greater potential</i>" from the announcement seems hollow and a serious case of the NIH syndrome.   Lastly, Java isn't even that great a language or has a great runtime that so many talented hackers should be wasting their time on it. Isn't there anyone who can come up with a good general purpose programming language with a good and minimal standard runtime environment and a Free language and runtime specification? I am talking of an imperative language with the ability to easily do OO-programming but where OO is not sickeningly mandated.

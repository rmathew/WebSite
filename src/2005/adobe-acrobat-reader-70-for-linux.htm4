<p>
Acrobat Reader 7.0 <i>is</i><a href="ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/unix/7x/7.0/enu/">available</a> for Linux, but for some reason the main download page still shows 5.0 as the last supported version for Linux. This version takes up around 93MB (!) of disc space, but feels and shows documents <i>much</i> better than any of the other PDF viewers for Linux that I have had a look at.

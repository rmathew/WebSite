It is not often that I <i>fully</i> agree with an article written by Joel Spolsky, but <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html">this one</a> is an exception. As someone who has been interviewing people for his employers for over eight years, I can attest to the steady deterioration in the quality of candidates I talk to and the depressingly continuous lowering of my expectations over the years when I walk into the interview room.

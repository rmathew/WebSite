While reading <a href="http://www.osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=9776">the user comments on an OSNews story</a> about "<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/events/escape_fosdem05.html">Escape the Java Trap!</a>", I came across this wonderful Flash demo by Andrew Overholt showing off Eclipse running with GCJ and using Glade! It's a different thing to read about this in the mailing lists but an entirely different thing to actually see it in action! Cool!

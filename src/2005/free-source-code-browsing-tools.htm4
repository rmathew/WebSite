<p>
I would like to use a tool that would allow me to easily browse large bodies of source code (for example GCC). I <i>do not</i> need an IDE. The tool should: <ul> <li>be able to run on a modern Linux system. </li> <li>be free to use and free to modify. </li> <li>support at least C, C++ and Java out-of-the box, with easy extensibility to other languages. </li> <li>be fast (to create indices, to respond to user actions), lean on resources and intuitive. </li> <li>be kept up-to-date and actively maintained. </li> <li>have a graphical user interface (desirable, but not necessary). </li></ul> I have looked at <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">Exuberant Ctags</a> (for <tt>vi</tt>), <a href="http://sourcenav.sourceforge.net/">Source Navigator</a>, Hypersrc/Pypersrc, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/global/">GLOBAL</a> etc., but do not fully like any of them. Source Navigator comes the closest to filling my needs, but has an ugly interface and (more importantly) does not seem to be maintained at all (for example, no one has bothered to fix the usage of "<tt>-fwritable-strings</tt>", which newer GCCs do not support anymore).  So for people who do not use IDEs, is there no tool that measures up to these requirements?

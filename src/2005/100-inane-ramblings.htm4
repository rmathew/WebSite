I have put in more than 100 inane entries into my Advogato diary by now. <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jag?entry=transcendental_meditation">Here</a> is a nice weblog entry (try to ignore the awfully distracting background image) by James Gosling talking about the problems in "correctly" implementing <tt>sin()</tt> and other trigonometric functions in Java. Yumpee had pointed me to some nice papers by some of his fellow Googlers a while ago. They make for some great reading. Try to at least read the papers on Google FS, MapReduce and Sawzall (in that order).   Some day, I hope to be able to decipher what <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/graydon/34977.html">Graydon says</a> about programming languages.

Thanks to <a href="http://www.hackgnu.org/">Ramakrishnan</a> (a.k.a. "VU3RDD" on <a href="http://www.hackgnu.org/amateur.html">Amateur Radio</a>), I now have the complete set of <a href="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/">SICP Lecture Videos</a>. Now I need to burn these videos to DVDs and then take the time to watch them. Thanks a lot to all the others as well who offered to help me get these videos.  By the way, my first attempt to burn these to DVDs failed because I had not realised the <a href="http://www.videohelp.com/dvd">sundry incompatible formats</a> in which DVDs come. I had access to a DVD+RW drive and I had initially bought DVD-R discs. Thankfully, I could get a refund on all the discs except the one that I had opened.

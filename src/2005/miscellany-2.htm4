<a href="http://www.codesourcery.com/sourcerers/paul_brook.html">Paul Brook</a> has created a Free replacement for kqemu called <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/qvm86/">qvm86</a>. Both are Linux kernel modules that enable QEMU to run guest operating systems at near-native speeds. kqemu is unfortunately closed-source though it is free of cost for non-commercial use.  SRM-238 was only slightly less worse than SRM-236. Muddled thinking ("coder's block"?) once again ensured that I could solve only one of the problems in the given time. I really suck as a coder. I should also stop writing about SRMs.  <a href="http://www.klomp.org/mark/">Mark Wielaard</a> has written <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/130796/">a nice article on GCJ in LWN.net</a>. I did not completely grok Nathan Myers's (ncm) problems with the design of the Java language as written in the comments section for that article. Ditto for <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/java.html">Jamie Zawinski's</a> problems with Java for that matter. I have a <i>long</i> way to go before I can even begin to understand some of the objections people have for the design of programming language.   It sucks big time that <a href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/gtkhtml/">gtkhtml</a> requires the whole GNOME schmear. Unwieldy dependencies seem to be the general rule in Gtk/GNOME-land. Time to learn <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/index.html">Qt</a>.

There are some books on computer science that I had never heard of until I had started reading "<a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the Ultimate</a>" (LtU). I found these books being mentioned and recommended in various posts and forum topics on LtU from time to time. As I found out more about these books, I became interested in reading them. Since they were relatively obscure, I had no hopes of finding them here in India. The prospect of having to fork out hefty sums of money for buying the books via something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> made me apply the brakes on my normal impulse of buying an interesting book when I come across it.
<p>
Imagine my delight then, when I stumbled upon the fact that <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> of these books had an Indian reprint available at an extremely affordable price. Incidentally, all of these books were originally published by <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/">MIT Press</a> and the Indian reprints are published by <a href="http://www.phindia.com/">Prentice-Hall of India</a>.

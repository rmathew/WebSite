I like to pretend that I am interested in compiler construction techniques. I was therefore quite interested in attending the New Horizons in Compilers (<a href="http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/%7Euday/NHC-06/">mirror</a>) workshop that will be held as a part of <a href="http://www.hipc.org/">HiPC</a> 2006 right here in <a href="http://www.iisc.ernet.in/">IISc Bangalore</a>. Unfortunately, it turns out that you have to register for the <span style="font-style: italic;">entire</span> conference to be able to attend this workshop. The really awful part is that I would have to part with <span style="font-style: italic;">22,500 rupees</span> ($500) to be able to do that. There is no way that I am ever going to shell out that kind of money for something like this.

Apparently this is supposed to be <a href="http://www.hipc.org/hipc2006/india.html">the "reduced rate" for Indian participants</a> who are not from academia, government organisations or three-four letter organisations. Even for ACM/IEEE/IFIP members, it is still 16,900 rupees ($375) and that is still a lot of money in this part of the world for this kind of an event. It is as if they are making an active attempt to keep everyone else out. I did ask the "registration chair" and the workshop organisers for a better option but apparently there is none.

What a shame!

<a href="http://www.google.com/indiacodejam/">Google Code Jam India</a> is back. It was quite popular here in India the last  time around. I still haven't decided whether I should participate. I haven't been participating in <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc">TopCoder</a> matches for a while now and even while I was, my rating was steadily and embarrassingly declining with every match. I can blame it on <a href="http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5519055">a brain that deteriorates with age</a> or more honestly admit that even though I like coding and computer science in general, I'm not really as good at it as I would like to believe.

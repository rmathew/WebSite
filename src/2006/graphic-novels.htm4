I am quite intrigued by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel">graphic novels</a> and look forward to reading some of them, especially those by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Moore">Alan Moore</a>. I was therefore very happy when I spotted some graphic novels in <a href="http://www.landmarkonthenet.com/">Landmark</a>, Blossoms and <a href="http://www.crosswordbookstores.com/">Crossword</a> here in Bangalore. The happiness was rather short-lived as I discovered that they were quite expensive. There is no way I am going to shell out 800 rupees for such a thing when I don't even know if I am going to like it and especially since many of them are in a rather battered condition probably caused by many people browsing through them but then deciding to not buy them.

FOSS.IN/2006 will be held between November 24-26 at the J. N. Tata Auditorium
in <a href="http://www.iisc.ernet.in/">IISc Bangalore</a>. This event used to
be called &ldquo;Linux Bangalore&rdquo; and is justly touted as
&ldquo;India&`#'39;s Premier Annual Free and Open Source Software Event&rdquo;.
It has been organized every year since 2001 by the Bangalore Linux Users&`#'39;
Group (BLUG). Atul Chitnis&`#'39;s diary entry has some more information.
<p>
I have personally attended only two of these events and I regret not having
attended more of these. FOSS.IN/2005 was fairly good and mostly fun. I hope to
be able to attend this year&`#'39;s event as well.

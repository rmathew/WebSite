<a href="http://www.advogato.org/article/897.html">Advogato is going offline</a>.
<p>
I feel a bit sad about it even though I had stopped updating <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/rmathew/">my Advogato diary</a> and have been using Blogger for blogging for the last three months. After all, Advogato is where I started blogging regularly.
<p>
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/article/897.html#24">mibus provides a nice tip</a>: You can access all your Advogato diary entries in a convenient XML format by appending "diary.xml" to your normal diary URL. For example:
<p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><code>http://www.advogato.org/person/rmathew/diary.xml</code><br /></div><br />There is a "<a href="http://advogato.ev-en.org/">Planet (Former) Advogato</a>" for aggregating the blogs of all those who used to blog on Advogato but have moved elsewhere for one reason or the other.

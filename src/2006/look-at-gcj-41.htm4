Mark Wielaard has written another article for <a href="http://www.lwn.net/">LWN.net</a> titled "<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/171139/">A look at GCJ 4.1</a>" (where he also looks at GCJ 4.2 and beyond). It is subscribers-only for the moment (for a week), but if you are interested in Linux in any way, you should seriously consider subscribing to LWN. It's quite good.

I came to know of Mark Chu-Carroll's &quot;<a
href="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/">Good Math, Bad Math</a>&quot; blog via <a
href="http://jaortega.wordpress.com/2006/05/14/a-minsky-machine-to-play-with/">a
post in &ldquo;Programming Musings&rdquo;, the blog of Jos&eacute; Antonio
Ortega Ruiz</a>. Mark writes mostly about mathematics, the theoretical
foundations of programming, debunking bad use of mathematics in popular and
not-so-popular media, etc.
<p>
I find many of Mark's articles very interesting to read, though many others go
way over the top of my head. Some of his recent articles that I found really
interesting include <a
href="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/2006/08/16/roman-numerals-and-arithmetic/">one
that shows how absurd arithmetic with Roman numerals can be</a>, <a
href="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/2006/08/15/the-poincar-conjecture/">one on
Poincar&eacute; Conjecture</a>, some in the <a
href="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/category/good-math/pathological-programming/">&ldquo;Friday
Pathological Programming Language&rdquo;</a> series, <a
href="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/2006/07/21/zero/">one on zero</a>, <a
href="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/2006/08/01/i-the-imaginary-number/">one on
<i>i</i></a>, <a

&Pi;</a>, <a
href="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/2006/08/03/something-nifty-a-taste-of-simple-continued-fractions/">one
on continued fractions</a>, etc. The <a href="http://goodmath.blogspot.com/">old
home for the GM/BM blog</a> contains <em>many more</em> interesting and
insightful articles on math and programming theory. What an amazing guy!
<p>
Highly recommended.

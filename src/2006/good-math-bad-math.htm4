I came to know of Mark Chu-Carroll's &quot;<a href="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/">Good Math, Bad Math</a>&quot; blog via <a href="http://jaortega.wordpress.com/2006/05/14/a-minsky-machine-to-play-with/">a post in "Programming Musings", the blog of José Antonio Ortega Ruiz</a>. Mark writes mostly about mathematics, the theoretical foundations of programming, debunking bad use of mathematics in popular and not-so-popular media, etc.
<p>
I find many of Mark's articles very interesting to read, though many others go way over the top of my head. Some of his recent articles that I found really interesting include one that shows how absurd arithmetic with Roman numerals can be, one on Poincar&eacute; Conjecture, some in the "Friday Pathological Programming Language" series, one on zero, one on <span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>, one on <span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>, one on &Phi;, one on &Omega;, one on &Pi;, one on continued fractions, etc. The <a href="http://goodmath.blogspot.com/">old home for the GM/BM blog</a> contains <em>many more</em> interesting and insightful articles on math and programming theory. What an amazing guy!
<p>
Highly recommended.

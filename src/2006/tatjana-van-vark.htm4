<a href="http://www.tatjavanvark.nl/">Tatjana van Vark</a> looks like an amazing Dutch inventor and machinist. Just look at her works and you'll know what I mean. My favourites were the <a href="http://www.tatjavanvark.nl/tvvc/scop.html">oscilloscope</a> that she created when she was just 14 years old and an Enigma-like "<a href="http://www.tatjavanvark.nl/tvv1/pht10.html">Coding Machine</a>". I just wish they had put up some more information about the devices than just the pictures. Another of those humbling experiences for yours truly.

<a href="https://rmathew.com/software/index.html#zinc">ZINC</a> is a variant of the game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War">Core War</a> in which programmes (called "warriors") fight each other in a battle to control a virtual computer. The programmes are written in a simple language called Redcode and run inside an emulator known as Memory Array Redcode Simulator (MARS). ZINC implements a simpler and more symmetric dialect of the Redcode language than the current International Core War Society (ICWS) standard known as <a href="http://www.koth.org/info/icws94.html">ICWS-94</a>.  To get a feel for ZINC and Redcode, look at the following simple warrior: <pre>       ; Bomb every fourth cell in the core with a "DAT #0".       org start     target:       dat #0     start:       add #4, $target       mov #0, @target       jmp $start </pre> Redcode looks very similar to the assembly language of many modern microprocessors. A <tt>DAT #0</tt> instruction indicates the number <tt>0</tt> stored as the datum at that location in memory. This instruction is itself encoded as <tt>0</tt> and is not executable - an attempt to execute this instruction leads to the death of a warrior. So the warrior shown above (called "Dwarf", a classic Core War warrior) bombs every fourth location in the core in the hopes of fatally wounding an opponent. Note that Core War only supports relative addressing and <tt>@</tt> represents indirect addressing (the location pointed to contains a pointer to the final location). More details, including a tutorial for beginners, are available in the ZINC User Manual as well as on sites like <a href="http://www.koth.org/">www.koth.org</a> and <a href="http://www.corewar.info/">www.corewar.info</a>. There is also an active USENET newsgroup <tt>rec.games.corewar</tt> for Core War enthusiasts.   ZINC is currently at version 0.1 and is Free Software released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public Licence</a> (GPL).   By the way, I expect to receive a lot of flame for my decision to <a href="https://www.advogato.org/person/rmathew/diary/136.html">not recognise TAB characters as whitespace</a> in the Redcode dialect implemented by ZINC.

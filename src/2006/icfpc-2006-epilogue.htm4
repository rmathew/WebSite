The <a href="http://boundvariable.org/scoreboard.shtml">results of the ICFP contest for 2006</a> are now available. &quot;Team Smartass&quot; came first, followed by &quot;kuma-&quot; and &quot;You Can't Spell Awesome Without ASM&quot; in the second and third places respectively. Amazingly, the lone hacker &quot;Witrala&quot; was able to take the fifth place. Congratulations!
<p>
There is also a <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6419094369756184531">a video of the presentation by the contest's organisers at ICFP 2006</a>. It is quite shaky, there are audio and video synchronisation problems and there is a guy sitting near the camera who gets tickled by almost everything into laughing out loud, but it is still worth a watch, especially for those who participated in the contest or those who want to know just how the organisers created the task.
<p>
This year's contest has proved to be so popular that the organisers have created a separate site called <a href="http://boundvariable.org/">boundvariable.org</a> dedicated to the &quot;<a href="http://boundvariable.org/task.shtml">Cult of the Bound Variable</a>&quot;.

An interesting bit about this year's contest was that <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/09/and-awards-go-to.html">the teams in the first and the third places were both from Google</a>. Another interesting bit is that the individual members of these teams are also ranked very high on <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc">TopCoder</a> and have been toppers in various contests organised by TopCoder. &quot;Team Smartass&quot; comprised Christopher Hendrie (<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=305142">ChristopherH</a>), Derek Kisman (<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=272072">SnapDragon</a>), Ambrose Feinstein (<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=153505">ambrose</a>) and Daniel Wright (<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=114853">dmwright</a>). &quot;You Can't Spell Awesome Without ASM&quot; comprised John Dethridge (<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=270505">John Dethridge</a>), Ralph Furmaniak (<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=301937">RalphFurmaniak</a>), Tomasz Czajka (<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=144400">tomek</a>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_W._Barton">Reid Barton</a> (<a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=260835">reid</a>).

<b>Update (2006-10-22):</b> <a href="http://www.yumpee.org/">Yumpee</a> has pointed me to <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/papers/contest/icfp2006.pdf">the ICFP 2006 paper</a> (PDF) written by the organisers.

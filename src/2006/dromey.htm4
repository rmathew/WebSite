&ldquo;How to Solve it by Computer&rdquo; by R. G. Dromey is inspired
by George Polya's classic book on problem-solving &ldquo;How to Solve
it&rdquo;. This book explores how good problem-solving techniques can
be applied in computer programming to come up with efficient
algorithms for many problems.

The problems discussed range from the trivial (&ldquo;summing up the
elements of an array&rdquo;, for example) to the more interesting
(&ldquo;finding a given sub-string in a line of text in sub-linear
time&rdquo;, for example). For almost every problem, the author first
helps the reader come up with a quick and dirty solution and then
refine it in stages to make it very efficient. If possible, you should
stop after reading the description of a problem and try to come up
your own solution. You can then compare your solution with the one
the author develops to see how they compare. The sample
implementations of the algorithms are in Pascal.

This book nicely complements ordinary textbooks on Data Structures
and Algorithms and should be read by every serious programmer. I
personally feel that it is one of the most under-appreciated books
in Computer Science. The Pascal programmes are easy to understand and
to translate to the programming languages that are popular today.
This would also give you a chance to think about and analyse the
actual implementation of the final algorithm.
<p>
There are a couple of minor irritants in this book though. The text
is a bit verbose at times and I think some of the more trivial
problems could have been safely left out. If you are willing to gloss
over these though, it can prove to be really useful.

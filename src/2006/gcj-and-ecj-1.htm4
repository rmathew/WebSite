Tom has <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java/2006-03/msg00031.html">asked</a> the GCC Steering Committee to provide their verdict on the proposed use of the Eclipse compiler for Java in GCJ. This follows his earlier <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java/2006-01/msg00187.html">proposal</a> to abandon GCJX for GCJ and adopt ECJ instead. As of this writing, there has been no response from the GCC SC yet.

Thanks to Anirban Mukherjee, I came across <a href="http://www.danam.co.uk/Sanskrit/Sanskrit%20Introductory/Sanskrit%20Introductory.html">a nice document</a> (<a href="http://www.alkhemy.com/sanskrit/learning_tutorial_wikner/wikner.pdf">2.5MB PDF</a>) written by Charles Wikner containing introductory lessons for the Sanskrit language. Just take a look at the first chapter to see why I personally consider the phonetically precise Devanagari script to be far superior than the utterly challenged and much abused Roman script, even at the risk of appearing jingoistic.

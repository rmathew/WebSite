It is utterly disgusting that Microsoft so readily bends over backwards to please the immensely greedy folks from the entertainment industry.
<p>
For example:<br /><ul><li>The consumer suffers as <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/%7Epgut001/pubs/vista_cost.txt">Windows Vista goes out of its way to degrade the performance of hardware in the presence of "premium content"</a>.</li><li><a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061109-8187.html">$1 from every Zune sold by Microsoft goes to Universal Music</a> even if the player is never used to store or play any song published by Universal Music.</li><li>If you share a song with your friends via your Zune, <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/silverman/4350311.html">they would only be able to listen to it three times within three days</a> (whichever is earlier), <span style="font-style: italic;">irrespective</span> of whether the original song that you are sharing has any such restrictions.<br /></li></ul>

<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330884">Firefox leads to a breakup</a>. I don't know whether I should feel sorry for the bloke who was dumped or the lady who had to change her email address possibly after being bombarded with tonnes of silly emails. I do know that I found this bug report rather funny.  As I had feared, I performed miserably in the qualifying round of the <a href="http://www.google.com/indiacodejam/">Google Code Jam India 2006</a>. Good luck to the people who moved on to the next round.

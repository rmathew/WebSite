Sriram Krishnan writes an interesting <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sriram/archive/2006/01/15/lisp_is_sin.aspx">weblog entry</a> on Lisp. As a side-effect, it made me read some of <a href="http://www.norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a>'s essays and mark his book "<a href="http://www.norvig.com/paip.html">Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp</a>" as well as Richard Gabriel's book "<a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/Books.html">Patterns of Software: Tales from the Software Community</a>" for later reading.

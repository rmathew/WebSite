<tt></tt><tt>comp.compilers</tt> <a href="http://compilers.iecc.com/comparch/article/06-01-005">has turned twenty</a>. It is one of the few USENET newsgroups that I try to read regularly and whose moderator <a href="http://www.johnlevine.com/">John R. Levine</a> has done a rather fine job over the years of keeping the signal-to-noise ratio high enough. He is also known to put in editorial remarks, almost always at the end, in many a post that either answer a question outright or contain pointers to useful material or contain quirky and mostly amusing remarks. Kudos to him and the community that sustains this awesome resource.

<a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a> will be talking about "Free Software: Current Status and Challenges" at 11 AM in the Faculty Hall in <a href="http://www.iisc.ernet.in/">IISc Bangalore</a> <span style="font-style: italic;">tomorrow</span> (Saturday, 19<sup>th</sup> August 2006). I came to know of this event just this afternoon and I understand that this is too short a notice, but I hope to meet some of the fellow Free Software enthusiasts in Bangalore.
<p>
On a related note, <a href="http://www.gnu.org.in/node/117">Bangalore will also be hosting</a> the <a href="http://gplv3.gnu.org.in/">Fourth International Conference on GPLv3</a> on the 23<sup>rd</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup> August 2006, this time in IIM-B. Both Richard Stallman and Eben Moglen will be presenting in this event. Since this falls in the middle of a work week (Wednesday/Thursday), I will have to skip it.

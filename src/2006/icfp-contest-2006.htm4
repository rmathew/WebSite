Those interesting in programming might want to check out the <a href="http://www.icfpcontest.org/">ICFP Contest</a> for 2006 which will be held during the coming weekend (21<sup>st</sup> to 24<sup>th</sup> July 2006). The problems are generally open-ended and fun to solve even if your entry does not make it to the top - check out <a href="http://www.icfpcontest.org/previous.shtml">the problems from the previous years' contests</a> to see what I am talking about.

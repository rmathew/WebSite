Seen on Slashdot: "<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/02/13/1439232">What Was Your First Computer?</a>"  The first computer I worked on was the <a href="http://www.sclindia.com/">SCL</a> Unicorn which was a clone of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro">BBC Micro</a> Model B. This was a microcomputer based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6502">6502</a> microprocessor and came with the OS and an interpreter for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_programming_language">BASIC</a> on ROM and 32KB of RAM.

<a href="http://reddit.com/">reddit.com</a> regulars would have surely noticed several <a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/">articles from Stevey Yegge's blogs</a> bubbling up with a lot of moderation points. I must admit that I spent more than a couple of hours reading many of his articles. As with <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>, I might not agree with everything he says but I have to say that he writes fairly well most of the time (though he is a bit verbose and somewhat incoherent at times).

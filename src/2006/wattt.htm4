&ldquo;Writers and Their Tall Tales&rdquo; is the second book I have
read in the &ldquo;<a
href="http://www.scholastic.co.uk/zone/book_dead-famous.htm">Dead
Famous</a>&rdquo; series of books (the first one was on William
Shakespeare). It is a light book written in a humourous manner and
is loaded with comic illustrations.

It talks about some famous authors
like William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, etc. and
discusses a couple of their respective works in brief. I enjoyed it,
but not as much as I did the first one, probably because the novelty
has worn off. They only seem to consider British authors and the
&ldquo;secret diary&rdquo; entries get a bit tiresome after a while. It
is still a decent quick introduction to these authors for young
teenagers.

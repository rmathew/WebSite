After a long procrastination, I have finally updated <a href="https://rmathew.com/">my website</a> to be more standards-compliant, better looking and somewhat easier to navigate. I wanted to shift completely over to XHTML but <a href="http://www.hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml">that has its problems</a> besides <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticisms_of_Internet_Explorer#XHTML">lack of support in Internet Explorer</a>. I have therefore settled for HTML 4.01 Strict. Every page on my website should now validate with <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">the W3C validator</a>. To enhance the looks of the site, I am using a variant of the <a href="http://haran.freeshell.org/oswd/sinorca/">Sinorca 2.0</a> design created by haran and provided by <a href="http://www.oswd.org/">OSWD</a>. I stumbled upon OSWD while admiring the recent makeover of Tom's site (which uses the <a href="http://www.oswd.org/design/information/id/1152">Blue Haze</a> design also created by haran).  While I was at it, I renamed the folders and files that had names like "phartz", "philez", etc. - these names had looked "kewl" half a decade ago, but now look rather juvenile. This results in some of the links posted elsewhere becoming invalid and I apologise to anyone affected by this change. I have also implemented support for simple expandable and collapsible sections so that some of the pages do not appear intimidatingly verbose.  Right now the website is mostly an exercise in vanity. I need to add content that is actually useful so that someone other than googlebot finds the website interesting.

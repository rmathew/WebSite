I spent the first weekend of my current trip exploring the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco%2C_California">San Francisco</a>, first with VikGup and Pooja and then with Ananth and Surabhi. I will also be going to the city almost every day this weekend and the whole of next week, but I do not expect to have much time that I can spend exploring the city (which is a shame since I have really liked what I have seen of this city so far).
<p>
One of the first things that I noticed about this city was its diversity - there are so many people of so many ethnicities that it seems to be about as cosmopolitan as any city can possibly get. The next thing I noticed was the ruckus created by motorcycle riders (mostly riding Harley-Davidsons) almost everywhere. Finally, I really didn't expect the city to be so small!
<p>
I was with VikGup and Pooja for some time on the first day and then I walked around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Embarcadero_%28San_Francisco%29">The Embarcadero</a>, visited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman%27s_Wharf%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California">Fisherman's Wharf</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Street_%28San_Francisco%29">Market Street</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California">Chinatown</a>, etc.
<p>
The next day with Ananth and Surabhi, I saw the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge">Golden Gate bridge</a>, visited Haight-Ashbury and the <a href="http://www.amoeba.com/">Amoeba </a>store, ate at Massawa (an Ethiopian restaurant) on Haight street, indulged in the creations of <a href="http://www.ghirardelli.com/">Ghiradelli</a>, went up the steep roads of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Hill%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California">Russian Hill</a> and down the hairpin bends of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_%28San_Francisco%29">Lombard Street</a>, etc.
<p>
A charming city. I wish I were able to explore it properly.

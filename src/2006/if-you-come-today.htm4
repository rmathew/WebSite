"If you come today, it's too early. If you come tomorrow, it's too late. You pick the time."

Sriram pointed out <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=-PFURM9eA_Q">a video of the (English) song "If You Come Today"</a> sung by and featuring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkumar">Rajkumar</a>. The <a href="http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/%7Esangramraje/Lyrics-IfYouComeToday.html">lyrics</a> of the song are rather confounding, but my favourite parts are the "Tick, Tick, Tick, Tick..." and the "DOHLING!".

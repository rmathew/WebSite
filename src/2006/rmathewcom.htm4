I have finally registered the domain <a href="http://rmathew.com/">rmathew.com</a> for myself. It just points to my site hosted by Hosting Zero. The registration was surprisingly easy and rather quick. Within just a couple of minutes, the domain was accessible and the redirection was working. I chose <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy.com</a> even though they were more expensive for just the registration than <a href="http://domains.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> because their private registration add-on turned out to be slightly cheaper on the whole than that of Yahoo! - I really do not want random people to access my personal information via a <a href="http://www.whois.net/">WHOIS</a> lookup.  The "gotcha" about this registration turned out to be the fact that I inadvertently ended up with a pre-approved payment agreement with GoDaddy.com on my PayPal account, even though I had paid all the amount upfront and had marked my domain for <i>manual</i> renewal. Talking to their customer support didn't help much except stuff my mailbox with verbose and heavily graphic HTML messages. I have tried to contain the damage a bit by limiting the monthly outflow to USD 0.01, but I don't think I'll be sticking with them after my domain registration expires.

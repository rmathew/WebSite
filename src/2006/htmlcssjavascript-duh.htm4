<a href="https://www.advogato.org/person/dorward/diary.html?start=48">dorward</a>: Thanks again for your comments. I don't know why it didn't occur to me to use GCC itself as a pre-processor. Some of the simple things I tried out worked well with GCC. I haven't checked out <a href="http://dorward.me.uk/software/dolt/">The Dolt</a> yet.  As for condition #2 ("JavaScript disabled, Stylesheets enabled") mentioned in <a href="https://www.advogato.org/person/rmathew/diary/160.html">my previous post on this topic</a>, I have found a better solution to the distracting "peek-a-boo" effect inherent in my previous solution. In the HEAD of the page, I have now put: <pre>     &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--       hideHiddenDivs( );     // --&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </pre> where <tt>hideHiddenDivs()</tt> is defined as: <pre>   function hideHiddenDivs( )   {     if( document.getElementById)     {       document.write(         '&lt;style type="text/css"&gt; div.hidden { display: none; } &lt;/style&gt;');     }   } </pre> I could have put this scriptlet inline, but there seems to be a problem with the parser of the W3C validator tool which complains about a "<tt>&lt;/style&gt;</tt>" that does not end a STYLE element.

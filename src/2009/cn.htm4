&ldquo;Computer Networks&rdquo; by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_S._Tanenbaum">Andrew S.
Tanenbaum</a> is a comprehensive text-book on the topic written by an
author with many popular text-books to his credit. There are more than
800 pages in this book, though the prose is fairly accessible and
peppered with the entertaining wit and sarcasm that is the hallmark of
the author's text-books. Even though its 2002 vintage shows through every
now and then, the book on the whole is fairly up-to-date and still quite
relevant. It is therefore a great text-book from which to teach yourself
about computer networks.

While the book talks about the seven-layered <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI model</a> for computer
networks as well as the much simpler TCP/IP model, it uses a hybrid
model to describe the relevant concepts and protocols. This model
comprises the Physical Layer, the Data-Link Layer, the Network Layer,
the Transport Layer and the Application Layer. I personally feel that
the model used in this book is a more natural fit to computer networks
as they exist today.
<p>
There are enough protocols described here, across all layers, to sate
the appetite of almost every person. At times the author describes the
politics behind the promotion of some of the protocols and the reasons
for some protocols becoming more dominant than others. You also get to
appreciate just how much effort has gone into these protocols to cope
with all sorts of network errors and the evolving needs of users. The
book covers a lot of wireless and mobile networking issues as well in
this edition to reflect their increasing importance in the modern world.
<p>
The sections on multimedia, cryptography and copyright issues,
while no doubt very interesting, seem a little out of place for this
book. Some of the figures do not appear anywhere close to their sites
of reference, which makes it a bit cumbersome to flip back and forth
between the relevant text and the respective figure. The book uses a
proportional font for code listings instead of the usual monospace fonts,
which makes it difficult to read through the code.
<p>
While this book is a great reference for the concepts related to
computer networks, it is not so great as an actual network programming
reference. You would be much better served for that purpose by one of
the books by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Richard_Stevens">W.
Richard Stevens</a>.

&ldquo;An Introduction to Database Systems&rdquo; by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_J._Date">Christopher J.
Date</a> is a classic text-book on database concepts by one of the
foremost writers and thinkers in the field. The book has been kept
fairly up-to-date over the years by the author and includes topics
like logic databases, temporal databases, decision support systems,
object databases, object-relational databases, etc. Most of the book
however concentrates on the relational data model and relational
database management systems. This is not surprising since most of the
popular database management systems today are based on this model and
the author too clearly prefers this data model over all the others.

Almost all of the text in this book is a wistful reflection on the pure
relational data model and its imperfect implementation in real database
management systems. This is actually quite good since it is quite
important for a serious student to know how things <i>ought</i> to be in
addition to how things actually are. The book teaches you how to design
good databases in general; it does not teach you the specifics of a
particular product like Oracle or DB2. Beyond a preliminary overview
of the general concepts, it will also not teach you writing complicated
SQL queries, query optimisation for a particular product or writing
stored procedures in PL/SQL. This book is what you need to get a solid
understanding of the concepts underlying modern database managements
systems.
<p>
The book is divided into a few logical parts, each part comprising
well-defined chapters. Each chapter has an introductory overview,
detailed exposition, summary of concepts, self-check exercises,
well-anotated bibliography and answers to selected exercises. There
are chapters on all the important concepts like the relational data
model, relational algebra and calculus, database integrity, SQL,
database normalisation, query optimisation, transactions, concurrency,
recovery, security, etc.
<p>
The book provides most of the examples in a weird language called
&ldquo;Tutorial D&rdquo; instead of SQL. It does not tell you much about
the data models and database systems prevalent before the relational
data model, depriving the student of a useful perspective on the
historical significance of this model. The book does not provide any
information on how relational databases could be implemented dismissing
it as a detail that varies from product to product. This is quite
unfortunate since it is very instructive to see how an abstract data
model is concretely implemented in an efficient manner.

My colleague Ryan stumbled upon a nice guide that explains the basics of equity and debt investment for Indians. It is available via the web-site for the <a href="http://www.nseindia.com/">National Stock Exchange</a> (NSE) as <a href="http://www.nseindia.com/content/ncfm/ncfm_modules.htm#14">the study material for the &quot;Financial Markets (Beginners)&quot; module</a> of its certification programme.

I had read this guide before since it has been passed around for some time in emails, but I never knew its origin. If you want to begin investing in the Indian markets, you can learn the fundamentals through this guide. Even if you have been investing for a while, it never hurts to brush up your basics.<br /><p>If you do invest, Deepak Shenoy has <a href="http://blog.investraction.com/2008/08/rules-for-investing-discipline.html">some advice</a> for you.

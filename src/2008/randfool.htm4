It is not easy to put &quot;<a
href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/">Fooled by Randomness</a>&quot;
by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb">Nassim
Nicholas Taleb</a> into one of the standard book categories like
&quot;Business&quot; or &quot;Science&quot; or &quot;Philosophy&quot;.
This is because the book is about all of these and more. The main
message of the book is that humans have an innate tendency to overlook
the randomness of most of the events in their lives and they must learn
to recognise this. Chance plays a much greater role in our lives than
we are willing to believe. The success or failure of a person depends
a lot on luck as well as the usual suspects like skills, hard work,
risk-appetite, etc.

<p>
The book shows how probability is misunderstood by most people. People
assign definite probabilities to events even when it is scientifically
impossible to do so and then proceed to perform elaborate calculations
based on such probabilities. Even when they have a fair idea of the
probabilities people tend to take the wrong decisions because they
forget to calculate the expected value of the possible outcomes. Many
of the examples used to illustrate these statements are taken from the
financial markets since the author is an options trader. The story of
&quot;Nero Tulip&quot; seems somewhat autobiographical.
<p>
The author makes no attempt to hide his contempt for many people
and for several commonly-accepted ideas. His motto is &quot;to tease
those who take themselves and the quality of their knowledge too
seriously&quot;. He reserves particular contempt for economists and
journalists. The book has many &quot;warnings against economists and
finance professors as they tend to believe that they know something,
and something useful at that&quot;. He does not shy from rubbishing
the typical MBA even though he holds an MBA himself. He thinks that
journalists are primarily entertainers and asks you to stay away from
those who are deluded into believing that they are thinkers.
<p>
If you think that this book will help you in profiting from the
apparent randomness of the financial markets then you will be
disappointed. It would help you to be on your guard while dealing
with this randomness. The author points out that contrary to what most
people think, randomness does not mean that there will never be any
recognisable patterns in the data under observation. It is dangerous
to be lulled by such occasional patterns into making ultimately costly
bets.
<p>
Many of the passages in the book make the author appear pompous,
arrogant or condescending. At times you feel as if the author just
wants to show off his acquaintances, his travels, his readings or his
aristocratic lineage. It is also difficult to understand some of the
passages without a background in finance, mathematics or philosophy.
Fortunately these distractions are not enough to deter you from
getting the main points so vividly made by the author.

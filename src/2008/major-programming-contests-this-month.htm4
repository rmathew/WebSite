There are a couple of major programming contests coming up this month. The first one is the <a href="http://www.icfpcontest.org/">ICFP Programming Contest 2008</a> (11-14 July). The second one is the <a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/">Google Code Jam 2008</a> (qualification round on 16 July).

There was also <a href="http://www.ddj.com/architect/207404123">an article in DDJ about programming contests</a> a couple of months back. It is an interesting read, but there is nothing new in there for those who are already familiar with <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a>.

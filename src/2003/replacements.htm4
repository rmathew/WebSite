I bought a <a href="http://www.success-hk.com/pp/item_detail.asp?itemID={C02A80E6-D472-4755-A7B7-3B2FAC1C2156}">Visoly   Flash Advance Xtreme 128M Card</a> for the GBA and it  turned out to be defective! Uggghhhhh... I have sent it back to the store for repair or replacement.  I have also bought a Lexar Media JumpDrive 256MB Secure USB Drive off eBay and am waiting for its arrival. Let us hope this one does not turn out to be a dud!

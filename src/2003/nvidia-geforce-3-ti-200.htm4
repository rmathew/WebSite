After several months, I finally laid my hands on the nVidia GeForce 3 Ti 200 that I had bought off eBay. With this upgrade, my system now scores 3968 on the <a href="http://www.futuremark.com/products/3dmark2001/">3DMark 2001</a> gaming benchmark - an increase of more than six times over my original configuration!  I hope this is just about enough to play <a href="http://www.halflife2.net/">Half-Life 2</a> and <a href="http://www.urulive.com/">Uru</a>. <tt>:-/</tt> I noticed that the <a href="http://www.lexarmedia.com/jumpdrive/index.html">LexarMedia JumpDrive 256MB USB drive</a> that I bought sometime back  was actually capable of storing only 245MB!  Sure enough, this was because they use 1000 bytes per kilobyte and 1000 kilobytes per megabyte to advertise storage space provided by the device like hard disc manufacturers do, instead of 1024 bytes/KB and 1024 KB/MB that is used by almost all operating systems.  <i>Uggghhh!!</i> By the way, the replacement for the defective <a href="http://www.success-hk.com/pp/item_detail.asp?itemID={C02A80E6-D472-4755-A7B7-3B2FAC1C2156}"> Visoly Flash Advance Xtreme 128M Card</a> arrived and  is working perfectly well. I am extremely pleased with  the great service from <a href="http://www.success-hk.com/">Success Compu</a>  (HongKong).  My hacking on GCJ has been quite erratic and  inconsistent - I feel really bad about it. I hope to  get to speed on this shortly (don't we all?).

I do not want to code for Windows any more!  As a developer, I have always enjoyed working on Linux and have hated working on Windows. In the recent past, I have been exposed to all sorts of Windows ugliness trying to make GCJ work on Windows - I did not enjoy it at all!  This just is not my cup of tea - I love working on Linux and that is what I shall do.

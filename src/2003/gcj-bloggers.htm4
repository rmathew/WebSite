For some wonderful and happy reason, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/tromey/">tromey</a>, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/mjw/">mjw</a>, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/Anthony/">Anthony</a> and Jeff have all suddenly become active on <a href="http://www.advogato.org/proj/GNU%20gcj/">GCJ</a> again, all at the same time, after being dormant for  several weeks! For some weird reason, they had also all gone  dormant at about the same time.  This weekend I finally found out that the intermittent and increasingly irritating crashes on my home PC while  building GCC on Linux was actually <a href="http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/">due to a defective RAM module</a> - after removing the offending module, everything was back to normal, even after extended stress testing.

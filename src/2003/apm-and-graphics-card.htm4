The graphics card upgrade caused me immense trouble with Linux - the machine would  freeze whenever the X server exited or when virtual console blanking kicked in.  After <i>much</i> troubleshooting and hunting over the Net, I finally managed to solve the problem by disabling APM in the kernel. Phew!  I was not terribly excited by the knowledge that the card is made by "Robanton", apparently a Taiwanese company whose  <a href="http://www.robanton.com/">site</a> works no more.

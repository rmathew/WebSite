&ldquo;The Search&rdquo; is a book by John Battelle that seeks to
explain &ldquo;How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business
and Transformed Our Culture&rdquo;. The book highlights how searching
for something or someone on the Internet is becoming such an integral
part of our lives and how companies are trying to profit from this
opportunity.

The book starts off rather badly with unnecessary verbiage comprising
the author's pontification on the importance of search, the
contribution of the combined search histories of Internet users
towards creating a &ldquo;Database of Intentions&rdquo; that essentially
represents what the world is looking for at a given point in time, the
immense value of such a database and the great responsibility that
rests with a company like Google that has such data. I have a feeling
that the author could have easily made the same point using an order
of magnitude fewer pages. Ditto for the final quarter of the book,
which I found to be an even bigger pain to read through.
<p>
Sandwiched between these is the interesting story of the rise and
the fall of the early search engines like WebCrawler, AltaVista, etc.
and the creation of Overture, Yahoo and Google. However, the bulk of
this book is devoted to the creation of Google, its early days, its
struggle with its IPO, the praise and the criticisms that it has been
receiving, etc. The author deserves praise for presenting a balanced
view of Google. I was a bit surprised that he didn't find anything
repulsive about Overture's method of sneaking in paid links among
genuine search results that are hard to discern for normal users. One
of the things that irritated me was that the footnotes for each
page were moved to a separate &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; section at the end
of the book, rather than at the bottom of the page, which made it a
bit difficult to read the chapters, as I had to keep flipping back
and forth.
<p>
If you have been using the Internet for some time and have even a bit
of intelligence, there is nothing terribly insightful or new in this
book.

Although &quot;Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer
Programming&quot; by Peter Van Roy and Seif Haridi looks
intimidatingly big at around 900 pages, I found it surprisingly easy
to read. It has a good balance of theoretical and practical
descriptions of the concepts covered by it. It has a cohesive
overview of the major programming styles in a manner that I have not
seen in any other book. I would rank it as a must-read for the serious
programmer along with classics like &quot;The Art of Computer
Programming&quot; and &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programming&quot;.

The authors introduce various models of computation that cover the
declarative and imperative styles of programming, including concurrent
variants of each style. The declarative (or stateless) models include
functional and logic programming while the imperative (or stateful)
models include object-oriented programming. The authors also introduce
some specialised models, for example, for distributed programming and
constraint programming. All of these models are introduced using a
<i>single</i> multi-paradigm programming language named &quot;<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oz_(programming_language)">Oz</a>&quot;,
that was developed by the research groups that the authors belong to
and that is implemented by the <a
href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/">Mozart</a> programming system. Oz
defines a small kernel language that provides the minimal support
needed for each model and then defines linguistic abstractions and
provides syntactic sugar that makes it convenient to programme in that
model. In addition, the authors also provide an overview of a
representative programming language for some of the models, including
Haskell, Erlang, Java and Prolog.
<p>
It is obvious that the authors prefer the declarative computational
model over the others, but they are honest and pragmatic enough to
admit that for at least some programmes, explicit state simplifies
the code and makes it more efficient. This is a refreshing change from
some authors who insist that functional programming, say, is all that
you should ever need and scoff at the mention of having the need to use
explicit state for some programming needs. I fully agree with the
authors that while explicit state cannot be avoided in some cases, one
should try to write as much code as possible using the declarative
model since it makes it easier to reason about the programme and
presents more opportunities for optimisation to the compiler or
interpreter.
<p>
One of the neat things I learnt from the declarative model presented
by the authors is the concept of a &quot;data-flow variable&quot;. A
variable is allowed to be unbound in addition to being bound to a
single value - if a part of a programme tries to access the value of
such an unbound variable in an expression, it is suspended till the
time that some other part of the computation binds a value to the
variable. This allows simple and reliable concurrency to be
programmed in a very neat manner. Another new thing for me was the
concept of a &quot;secure variable&quot;.
<p>
The authors make concurrent programming look much less intimidating
and more reliable using data-flow variables and message-passing,
though they also cover the kind of shared-state concurrent programming
using monitors provided by programming languages like Java. The book
also covers determining the space and time efficiency of procedures,
proving programme correctness, creating secure ADTs (Abstract Data
Types), implementing transactions, providing fault tolerance, etc.
You have to read the book to see how expansive the coverage really
is and how extensive the bibliography is (should you get curious and
decide to explore more about a given topic). This book is not for the
complete newcomer to programming though - you have to have had some
experience in programming and preferably some prior exposure to
different styles of programming to fully appreciate the material
presented in the book. As always for such a book, you should
definitely try out and play with the given examples in Mozart and
at least attempt some of the exercises to really benefit from the book.
<p>
There are some minor irritants in the book. For example, in the
preface and throughout the book the authors keep referring to
&quot;the book's web site&quot; but I could not find a single place
where the URL of the web site is provided! You have to use a search
engine to find out that <a
href="http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html">this page</a> is most
likely the intended place. The interactive development environment of
the Mozart programming system is based on <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> and I had to
first download and install this beast (that I had managed to avoid all
these years) before I could use Mozart. I am not sure if it is the
fault of <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> or the way
the authors have used this tool, but most of the figures are not
close to the places from where they are referenced, making you
flip back and forth unnecessarily between pages. Lastly, I personally
thought that for at least some of the models (notably explicit-state
and object-oriented), the support in Oz looks awkward unlike that for
the other models.
<p>
All of these irritants can easily be overcome and I would therefore
recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in computer
programming.

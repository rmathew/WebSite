<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/">QuickTime</a> would probably be the applications by <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> that most non-Mac-OS-X users get exposed to and it is a shame that these applications are so frustratingly unintuitive, not to mention bloated and slow. Are these really made by the same company that is famous for putting a lot of emphasis on the usability of its hardware and software products?

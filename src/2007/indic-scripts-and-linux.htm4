If you have the fonts for Indic scripts (for example, the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Lohit">Lohit fonts</a>), Firefox on Linux is able to display the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari">Devanagari</a> text on sites like <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/">BBC Hindi</a> and <a href="http://news.google.co.in/news?ned=hi_in">Google News in Hindi</a>. (Devanagari is the primary writing system for languages like Hindi, Sanskrit, etc.) However, if you are using the builds released by <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">mozilla.com</a>, you would notice that the <span style="font-style: italic;">matras</span> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic">diacritics</a>) are not applied properly to form the correct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_ligature">ligatures</a>. For example, the word "??????" ("Hindi") itself is not rendered properly. <a href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a> does not suffer from such problems.

It turns out that Firefox does not support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Text_Layout">complex text layout</a> because it doesn't use <a href="http://www.pango.org/">Pango</a> in the officially-released builds (Firefox 3 will support it by default). You have to either compile it yourself from the source and enable the support for Pango by using <tt>--enable-pango</tt>, or use a build that has Pango enabled - for example, the builds provided by the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Project</a>. (Setting the environment variable <tt>MOZ_ENABLE_PANGO</tt> to "1" had no effect for me with Firefox 2.0.0.3.)

On Fedora Core 6 (FC6), it is very simple to get this working:<br /><ol><li>Install the fonts for the Indic scripts you are interested in. For example, "<tt>sudo yum install fonts-hindi</tt>" , "<tt>sudo yum install fonts-malayalam</tt>", "<tt>sudo yum install fonts-kannada</tt>", etc.</li><li>Install a Firefox build for Fedora using "<tt>sudo yum install firefox</tt>". Note that FC6 installs Firefox 1.5 by default - if you prefer Firefox 2.0 instead, you can install it using "<tt>sudo yum --enablerepo=development install firefox</tt>".</li></ol>

By the way, I recently came across <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/">Omniglot</a>, a site about the writing systems of almost all known human languages, existing or extinct, naturally-evolved or artificially-created. I found it extremely fascinating and insightful. For example, I did not know that Devanagari was not considered to be an "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet">alphabet</a>" but an "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida">abugida</a>". Check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> (IPA) that can represent almost all spoken languages. How about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loglan">Loglan</a> (and its freer derivative, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a>) that claims to be a "logical" language? (I first came across the IPA on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, where it is used to provide the pronunciation for some terms. <a href="http://xkcd.com/c191.html">xkcd</a> is where I first read about Lojban.)

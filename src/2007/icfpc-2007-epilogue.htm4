The results of <a href="http://www.icfpcontest.org/">ICFPC</a> 2007 have finally been <a href="http://johanjeuring.blogspot.com/2007/10/endo-lives.html">announced</a>. Team Smartass from Google has come first (<a href="http://boundvariable.org/scoreboard.shtml">yet again</a>), followed by United Coding Team from the University of Cape Town (South Africa) in the <a href="http://marco-za.blogspot.com/2007/10/icfp-how-we-came-2nd.html">second place</a> and Celestial Dire Badger (a lone hacker named <a href="http://rlwinm.blogspot.com/">Jed Davis</a>) in the third place.

The organisers of the contest have <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/research/techreps/UU-CS-2007-029.html">an interesting report on the contest</a> that also contains the "ideal" way one would go about solving the puzzles. Interestingly, Jochen Hoenicke managed to find a perfect DNA prefix some time after the contest was over. Impressively, Jed Davis came third by using <a href="http://www.celestial-dire-badger.com/icfp/2007/report.html">a brute-force approach</a> that won him the Judges' Prize - he was declared to be "an extremely cool hacker".
<p>
<b>Update (2007-10-24):</b> The organisers have now shared the video of their presentation about the contest at ICFP 2007.

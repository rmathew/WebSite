I have come to believe that statistics is one of those important subjects
that most of us know woefully little about even as we increasingly rely
on the results of various studies to drive our lifestyle choices or on
data visualisation to take decisions at our workplace. That said, I have
been procrastinating on my resolution to study this subject in greater
depth than what was afforded by an introductory course I took in college
ages ago. The first step towards that goal has now been precipitated due
to the nature of my current work. Unfortunately for me, most of the
books on this subject looked too dull or intimidating
to serve as a useful review of the basic concepts. &ldquo;Head First
Statistics&rdquo; by Dawn Griffiths presented a welcome contrast with
its pages full of informal text and fun pictures, though I was sceptical
at first of its utility. I am happy to report that my scepticism was
entirely misplaced.

The book is another in the series of <a
href="http://headfirstlabs.com/">&ldquo;Head First&rdquo; books by
O'Reilly</a>. True to its pedigree, this book uses lots of little
stories, pictures and exercises to provide a gentle introduction to
otherwise complicated-looking topics. Each chapter asks you to help
denizens of the fictional town of &ldquo;Statsville&rdquo; with their
sundry problems using increasingly-complicated statistical techniques.
Unlike most text-books where the exercises are lumped together at the
end of each chapter or section, sometimes without solutions or hints,
this book makes the exercises an integral part of its flow and works
out the solution for each of them in full after letting you take a
crack at it first.
<p>
All the usual suspects of statistics are here: data visualisation,
mean, median, mode, standard deviation, probabilities, probability
distributions, normal curves, sampling, hypothesis tests, t-distribution,
chi-square distribution, etc. I was frankly a bit surprised that the
author managed to cover so much ground in a book like this. My kudos to
her for making most of it so accessible to the lay reader.
<p>
Of course, despite her valiant efforts the author loses her grip
on lucidity in the latter half of the book that covers advanced topics
and where many a formula or statement is left hanging with an implicit
&ldquo;Just take my word for it&rdquo;. This could be deeply dissatisfying
if you are of an enquiring disposition. There are no references to
books, papers, articles or web-sites where the reader can go to find
more information or get a deeper understanding of the concepts. There
should have been some practice problems for the reader to test their
understanding, with the solutions perhaps available from a web-site. One
of my major grudges was the sudden switch to probability from statistics
in the early chapters without any explanation - only if you persist do
you discover in the later chapters how closely the two are linked to
each other and get your &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moment of understanding.
Finally I really believe that the book could have been thinner given
the ground that it covers.
<p>
While I feel that this is a great book to use to get introduced to this
important subject, it is not suitable for use as a reference or as a
guide to get a deeper understanding of the concepts. It will certainly
whet your appetite for the subject and is a great book if you find
yourself scared by the subject.

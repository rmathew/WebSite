<p>
Most of us find ourselves working with a Microsoft OS most
of the time. Developers especially are likely to land up with
Windows NT (or its successor Windows 2000). Let's not even
talk about the other junk (Win9x/Win3.x/DOS) that MS dumps on us
in the name of an OS. Since I've only had experience with 
WinNT 4.0, this is the OS that I'll be dealing with in these
pages.

<p>
First off, be sure to apply the latest Service Packs (unless you
have some really good reason for not doing it). I've been using
SP 6a for some time now and the system has been working flawlessly
for me. Do not blame the OS unnecessarily for bugs that have long
since been fixed.

<p>
Next, to get the maximum out of your Windows NT system, be sure
to check out the excellent set of articles on 
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tweak/nt/index.html">Tweaking Windows NT</a>
at <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a>.
I will not needlessly repeat here all that is given there. Trust
me, these tips will help you boost your system's performance
<i>tremendously</i>!

<p>
That aside, proceed now with the rest of the article.

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> I will keep adding to these tips as I keep
discovering (and remembering) them, so be sure to check 
this page again after some time. Some of these are not
my original ideas, though some have been discovered 
by me independently - friends and the InterNet have contributed
significantly to a better experience on this OS for all of us.

<a name="prompt"><b>&quot;Open Command Prompt Here&quot;</b></a>
<p>
While using Windows Explorer, you sometimes wish you could go
straight to the folder you are browsing, and open a command
window in that folder. Ideally you would like to be able to
right-click and say &quot;Open Command Prompt Here&quot; and
be taken there directly in a command window. Some of the
Windows Desktop tweaking programs let you do precisely this.
<p>
However, if you do not have any of these, you can enable this
thing yourself by doing the following: In Explorer, open
&quot;View<code>-&gt;</code>Options&quot;, go to the &quot;File Types&quot;
tab, go to the &quot;Folder&quot; type under &quot;Registered
file types&quot;, click the &quot;Edit...&quot; button, 
click the &quot;New...&quot; button, type &quot;Open Command
Prompt Here&quot; in the Action text-field, and &quot;cmd.exe&quot;
in the Application text-field, click all the &quot;OK&quot;
buttons as they become visible...and you're done!


<p>
<a name="poweroff"><b>Power-off after shutdown</b></a>

<p>
Users of Windows 9x and Linux (and maybe other systems, I 
do not know) can do a &quot;power-off after shutdown&quot;.
This is immensely useful but is not available under standard
Windows NT 4. Several add-on packages let you do this, but
as far as I know, none of them are freely available.

<p>
However, I found a free (or so it seems) utility by HP
called <a
href="http://www.support.vectra.hp.com/vectrasupport/level4/621vdf507en.exe.html">SoftPowerDown</a>. This is supposedly for HP Vectra
machines, but I've found that it works on most ATX-based PCs with
APM BIOS support. You can use this utility to enable this feature
with your Windows NT 4. Be sure to apply at least SP 3 before this
though.

<p>
<b>WARNING:</b> I did not see it mentioned anywhere that you can
use it <i>only</i> if you have an HP Vectra. However, I might have
erred for all you know. Please check everything out properly before
you use this software. For the record, I do have an HP Vectra so
I do not have this problem.


<p>
<a name="autocomplete"><b>Auto Filename Completion</b></a>

<p>
Most of us developers who are used to <i>bash</i> under
Linux or other powerful shells are also used to the immensely
helpful feature there of filename completion: if you press
TAB after typing in a part of a filename, the shell will 
complete it for you. Moreover, if you press TAB again and again,
the shell will cycle through all the file names that match 
the partial name. Sadly, this feature is lacking (or so it seems)
in the Command Prompt shown by Windows NT.

<p>
Not really! Now you can enable this feature in NT by doing the
following: open <code>regedit</code> and look for the key
&quot;<code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor</code>&quot;,
look for the value named &quot;CompletionChar&quot; and change
its value to 9 (ASCII code for the TAB character), and you're done!
That's all there is to it.


<p>
<a name="remunins"><b>Remove Unwanted UnInstall Entries</b></a>
<p>
I wish most of the software vendors wrote their uninstallers
properly. Sometimes you find that the UnInstaller is not
working and that you're forced to remove files manually.
You have removed everything else, but that entry in 
&quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot; still remains. How do you
remove that?

<p>
Well, open up <code>regedit</code> and search for the key
&quot;<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall</code>&quot;. Now look at the sub-keys of this key, find
the offensive entry and just delete it. Simple.


<p>
<a name="remrunprog"><b>Remove Stupid Startup Programs</b></a>
<p>
Some of the software vendors think they are smarter than the
user and that the user should really be running their programs
every time he logs on to the system. Some of these programs
are put under the &quot;Startup&quot; sub-menu of the &quot;Start&quot;
menu and so are easily removable if you feel they are not needed and
are unnecessarily slowing down your system. But not some of the
others...

<p>
You can now even remove these stoopid programs yourself. Open
<code>regedit</code> and search for the key
&quot;<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</code>&quot;.
Now just see the values listed under this key and remove all
the programs that you don't want to be run every time you log on
to the system. Got 'em, huh?


<p>
<a name="sendto"><b>Control the &quot;Send To&quot; Menu</b></a>

<p>
In Windows Explorer, you can right-click on a file or a folder
and &quot;Send&quot; it to the floppy, &quot;My Briefcase&quot;
or whatever. It is easy to manipulate the contents of this
menu. If you've installed Windows NT in <code>C:\WinNT</code> (say),
just go to <code>C:\WinNT\Profiles\<i>yourlogin</i>\SendTo</code>, where
<i>yourlogin</i> is the login id by which you logged in to Windows
NT. Now create a shortcut to your favourite program, say, Notepad,
in this folder and this program will be visible in the &quot;Send To&quot;
menu. With this feature for example, you can very easily open a file
in Notepad by right-clicking on the file in Explorer, and saying
&quot;Send To&quot;<code>-&gt;</code>Notepad. Easy and convenient, huh?

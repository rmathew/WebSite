Once <i>again</i>, I have been bitten by bad RAM modules, this time in the Dell Optiplex GX270 machine I use at work. <a href="http://www.memtest86.com/">Memtest-86</a> was able to diagnose the problem after I spent almost a month wondering why programs randomly crashed on me and trying out all sorts of software updates.

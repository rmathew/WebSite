For some reason, the guys at Hosting Zero suddenly offered to host my site for free! So I moved my web site there. They seem to have <i>far more</i> facilities than <a href="http://www.tripod.com/">Tripod</a> where I used to host my site and have no irritating advertisements and popup windows.  Let us see how this works out. A <i>big</i> thanks to the guys at Hosting Zero - do check them out.

<p>
Please do not say or write "Mr Foo Bar" on first mention - just say "Foo Bar" the first time you refer to a person - after that, you can call him "Mr Bar". The Economist's Style Guide <a href="http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/index.cfm?page=805691"> spells it out nicely.</a> In fact, the "Mr Foo Bar" form is not proper at all, but is sadly used almost universally by (at least) English speaking Indians - just use the surnames with "Mr/Mrs/Miss" as in "Mr Bar".  This is not to say that I speak/write perfect English (I strive to, but mostly fail), but there are <i>some</i> things that irritate me more than others and this is one of them.

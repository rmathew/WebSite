&ldquo;<a href="http://www.davincicode.com/">The Da Vinci
Code</a>&rdquo; by <a href="http://www.danbrown.com/">Dan Brown</a> has
action, pace and intrigue sustained right throughout and not since
&ldquo;Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets&rdquo; have I wanted to
finish a novel in one day and enjoyed it all along! The plot can be
summed up as one big treasure hunt (with cryptic clues leading to more
clues, as in the eponymous game) for that ultimate Christian quest -
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail">Holy Grail</a>.

To that end, the author manages to weave a tale involving almost every
famous Occidental Christian persona, myth, legend or secret society
including the Divine Proportion (also known as &Phi; or the <a

Ratio</a>), the <a

the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar">Knights

etymology of common words like &ldquo;villain&rdquo;,
&ldquo;sinister&rdquo;, &ldquo;pagan&rdquo;, etc. Quite a lot for one
little novel!
<p>
Though the novel alleges that the Catholic Church did everything in
its power to sideline and almost vilify the role of women, especially
Mary Magdalene, I could not help but notice that the author seems to
forget about Mary, the mother of Jesus altogether and how she is
revered far more than what would be reasonable by just reading the
Gospels! Anyway, the book is one hell of a read and I would highly
recommend it to anyone.

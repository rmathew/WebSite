I came across this reproduction of an article by A. K. Dewdney in his "Computer Recreations" series in <a href="http://www.sciam.com/">Scientific American</a>. I am not exaggerating when I say that this was the series that fundamentally altered the way I looked at computers and programming. I long to read such articles now... <i>~sigh~</i> Of course, I already own copies of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0716719398">Armchair Universe</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262561271/">The Computational Beauty of Nature</a>", but a regular series like this would be quite welcome.

&ldquo;Unputdownable&rdquo; is how I would describe <a
href="http://www.philip-pullman.com/">Philip Pullman</a>'s superb
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.hisdarkmaterials.com/">His Dark
Materials</a>&rdquo; trilogy comprising &ldquo;The Golden Compass&rdquo;
(released as &ldquo;The Northern Lights&rdquo; in the UK), &ldquo;The
Subtle Knife&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Amber Spyglass&rdquo;. I am so glad
that I picked them up <i>after</i> all the three books had been
released as I cannot imagine how I would have borne the agony of
having to wait for a couple of years to find out how this delicious
saga unfolds.

Pullman combines the <i>multiverse</i> and <i>dark matter</i> theories
from modern physics with theology and pure fantasy to create a gripping
saga with only a few logical loose ends. The tale begins in a parallel
universe quite like ours (even in the names of places and their
relative geography) populated by humans who have externalised
polymorphic souls called <i>daemons</i>. The corrupt Church has
established a stifling theocracy and seeks to suppress anything that
goes against what it has propagated. In particular, it wants to reign
in and control the research into a recently discovered curious form of
matter called <i>Dust</i>.
<p>
The ebullient and charming heroine Lyra Belacqua and her daemon
Pantalaimon find themselves dragged from their blissful abode in
Oxford into what becomes the ultimate battle led by Lord Asriel
against The Authority (God) itself.  They are ably supported by the
brave Will Parry from our own world and a whole lot of other
characters including gypsies, witches, armoured bears, <i>mulefas</i>,
Gallivespians, etc.
<p>
While the story in the first book happens entirely in Lyra's world and
is quite linearly narrated with Lyra always at its centre, the next
two books have several threads of narration, many more prominent
characters and keep switching between worlds. The story is quite
gripping and the pace quite good. I did find the end a bit
disappointing and strange considering the ambitious swipe of the
story's plot, but I still found the book on the whole an extremely
satisfying read. I was a bit sad that it had to end and I keep wishing
I had an external daemon of my own too.
<p>
I would highly recommend this trilogy to anyone and I am so surprised
that it is not as popular as it ought to be. But for Ananth who pushed
me to read it, I would probably never have known about this epic.
Thank you Ananth! (By the way, he has named the hard disc partitions
on his computer Pantalaimon and Lyra, with the former being the boot
partition, as &ldquo;the boot has the sole (soul)&rdquo;. Yes, that
<i>is</i> awfully corny.)

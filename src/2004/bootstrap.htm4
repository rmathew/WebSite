In one of those now rare moods that used to be so common when I was new to Linux, I spent most of my week simply updating almost every package on my system to the latest stable release by compiling from source, including <tt>glibc</tt>! Much of it was a breeze (yes, even glibc), but Qt and KDE gave me the most grief - for some reason, <tt>uic</tt> from Qt simply omits the KDE headers required to access custom KDE widgets from KDE applications, causing the builds to irritatingly break every now and then. I think it is the fault of the "<tt>.ui</tt>" files in the KDE distribution, but wouldn't they have built and tested the distribution before release? I am confused, but I haven't found any answers via Google yet. <tt>&gt;:-(</tt> GCC keeps regressing in compile speed, especially for C++ code, with the result that Qt/KDE took an <i>enormous</i> amount of time to build with GCC 3.3.3 - I felt like going with Gtk+/GNOME just for this reason! But for some strange, possibly idiotic, reason, I persisted and the result is I must say quite pretty - KDE 3.2.1 feels much faster and is <i>so gorgeous</i> to look at! (For some reason, my display wallpaper change does not take effect at all, though Konqueror is able to display all these wallpapers just fine - does anyone have an idea why?)  An awesome side-effect is that everything is now rendered in TrueType fonts, albeit with so much weird anti-aliasing that it becomes difficult to read text for long. (A few years ago, I wouldn't have believed that <i>this</i> is going to be my primary complaint with my Linux desktop. <tt>:-)</tt> Who says we haven't made progress here?)

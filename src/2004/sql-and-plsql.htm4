After almost a <i>decade</i> of "abstinence", I am finally attending a training course on learing SQL and PL/SQL.  Two of the big products that I have been involved with at work (at my current as well as previous employer) have had almost all of the core business logic in PL/SQL, so saying "I'm a Java programmer - I won't look at that!" doesn't quite work that well when it comes to understanding these systems.  My fears and reluctance in learning these earlier were mostly unfounded - these are not that bad to learn and to use, though it seems that elegance is something that their designers didn't particularly have high on their minds.

Roger Sayle <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-07/msg00792.html">sums it up</a> nicely. I agree with him 100%. Even though I am a fringe and quite erratic contributor to GCJ (much less the core GCC), it has helped me <i>immensely</i> as a software developer. To paraphrase <a href="http://www.ucomics.com/calvinandhobbes/characters.phtml">Calvin's Dad</a>, "It helps build character".

This short novel by <a href="http://www.chetanbhagat.com/">Chetan Bhagat</a>
tells the story of the narrator and his two friends and their stay in <a
href="http://www.iitd.ac.in/">IIT Delhi</a>. While some of the lines did make
me chuckle and some made me say &quot;So true!&quot;, I still do not feel
that all the hype over this novel is justified. Some of the stuff was a bit
of an exaggeration too - this is <i>not</i> what generally happens in
the IITs people (the coke bottles episode, the making out with a
<i>professor</i>'s daughter thing, etc.)! Then again, IIT Delhi has always
been a bit different from the other IITs, so who knows. <tt>;-)</tt>

However, I do strongly agree with one of the main points made in the
novel - the IITs do make a student work unnecessarily
hard on getting decent grades, solving uninteresting and cliched
problems - they prepare one more for a plum industrial job than for
being able to innovate as an engineer. Much of your <i>aukaat</i> is
judged merely from your Cumulative Performance Index (CPI), as if that
is the only metric of someone's personality or capability (hence
the title of the novel). (Disclaimer: I happen to be a person
who was a <i>telu</i> of his batch with an utterly unimpressive
CPI to show for his four years at <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/">IIT
Kanpur</a>.)
<p>
The real benefit of an IIT (in my humble opinion) is in the resources
made available to the students at very reasonable rates and
(more importantly) in the ability to interact with many like-minded
and very bright individuals with varying cultural backgrounds. Many a
time this is enough of a stimulant for one to find interesting
things to do despite the frustrating rat race for grades. Some of the
best and long lasting friendships are made during these four years.
<p>
If you don't really get worked up over your grades, an IIT can be
a very nice place to be <i>despite</i> the bad food, the utter lack of
decent females, the pathetic living conditions and the delusional
and dictatorial faculty members!
<p>
Oh by the way, apart from being IIT alumni, Chetan and I also happen
to have wives with the same name (&quot;Anusha&quot;).

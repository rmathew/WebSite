&quot;The Silmarillion&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien is a collection of
tales that make up the epic mythology that forms the background of
&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (LOTR), this book and &quot;The
Hobbit&quot; are a must-read for anyone who wishes to fully appreciate
LOTR.

I liked it a lot, though it was a bit tiring in some places and
the abundance of characters and places was quite overwhelming. Having
read all the three books, I now take back my earlier claim that
Devakinandan Khatri's &quot;Chandrakanta&quot; and its sequels are
better than LOTR as epic works of pure fantasy. Tolkien has created
an astoundingly bigger and largely more consistent fantasy world, not
to mention with much fewer arbitrary twists in the stories.

My UPS by <a href="http://www.apcc.com/">APC</a> was out of action and at a service centre this weekend - it switched off while I was working on my computer and then started emitting these highly irritating beeps that I couldn't quite do much about (it being 11PM in the night). To add insult to injury, the service centre guys apparently kept it under observation for  two days and did not find any problems with it whatsoever!

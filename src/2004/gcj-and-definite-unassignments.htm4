I spent most of my free time this weekend trying to resolve some of the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java-patches/2004-q2/msg00415.html">issues</a> with definite [un]assignment in GCJ <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/defAssign.doc.html">as specified by the JLS</a>.  I just wanted to be able to see zero new FAILs with <a href="www.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/jacks/">Jacks</a>, but that goal proved to be quite elusive - I fix one bug and that uncovers problems elsewhere, I fix some of those bugs and they uncover some more, <i>ad nauseam</i> - I had to give up after a certain point and just came up with <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java-patches/2004-q2/msg00466.html">something</a> that is the least disruptive.  All this effort on something that I do not even agree completely with! I mean, this part of the JLS must be one of the shadiest - Sun has just converted into a specification whatever they felt they could reasonably implement in their own compiler, never mind if someone else can come up with a more thorough code flow analysis and give out less stoopid warnings. Sheesh!

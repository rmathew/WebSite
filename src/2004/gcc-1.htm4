Since there is no way my hopelessly unreliable dial-up link at home is going to let me synchronise with the GCC CVS repository (which is around 234MB of checked out files), I checked it out elsewhere(?), archived it and brought it home - from that point, checking out differential updates became possible even on my otherwise useless link. Now I finally have a CVS checkout of GCC that can be kept as updated as I wish.  What took me so long to implement this was the time taken to figure out <a href="http://www.htthost.com/">a way of using TCP/IP over HTTP behind a proxy server</a> so that CVS could be used, a way of carrying large amounts of data back home and the time taken to move my <i>glutius maximus</i>.  So I applied for, and got, write access to the GCC CVS this week, albeit not without <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/overseers/2004-q2/msg00004.html">problems</a> (why do <i>I</i> always run into such things?).

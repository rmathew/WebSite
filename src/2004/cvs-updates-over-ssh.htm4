<p>
The slow CVS updates from the GCC repository that I was facing were mostly due to <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/overseers/2004-q2/threads.html#00072">filesystem  corruption</a> on the machine hosting <tt>gcc.gnu.org</tt> and <tt>sources.redhat.com</tt>. Now that these problems have been fixed, my CVS updates over SSH are acceptably fast over my dial-up link at home.

My friend Ananth has just gifted me a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/157586326X/qid=1089009303">"Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About"</a>, a very different book by Donald Knuth. Having admired and being in awe of most of Knuth's work and being an atheist, this book should make some interesting reading for me.  Other recently acquired books on my "reading pending" list (besides almost the whole of my library) include <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/">"The Art of Unix Programming"</a> by Eric Raymond and <a href="http://www.chetanbhagat.com/">"Five Point Someone"</a> by Chetan Bhagat, a novel about life in an IIT.

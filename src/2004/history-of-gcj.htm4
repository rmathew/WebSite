Some time back, I stumbled upon "Cygnus Foundry Java Edition - Architecture and Design Manual". This document is somewhat dated and describes the <i>plans</i> more than what really has been implemented in GCJ, but it is still a good read and I would highly recommend it to anyone trying to understand GCJ.  I had my "<i>Aaaahhhh!!</i>" moments of comprehension reading this document, especially with the "Stack Slot Compilation", "Class Metadata", "Debugging Interpreted Java", "C/C++ and Compiled Java", etc sections.  <a href="http://www.klomp.org/mark/">Mark Wielaard</a> (<a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/mjw/">mjw</a>) has created "<a href="http://classpath.wildebeest.org/planet/">Planet Classpath</a>", a wonderful consolidation of weblogs maintained by GNU Classpath hackers. Kudos to him.   This weekend I spent time reading "<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/html/VMSpecTOC.doc.html">The Java Virtual Machine Specification</a>", something that I should have a done a very long time ago. I didn't finish it and I didn't understand everything, but a lot of things have become <i>much</i> clearer, including the meaning of <tt>(ID[Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Thread;</tt>. <tt>;-)</tt> I also played around with <a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~meyer/jasmin/">Jasmin</a>, an assembler for the JVM.   In 1995-96, when I was in the final year of my undergraduate studies at <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/">IIT-K</a> and Java was this new and cool language for creating web animations, most of us learnt this language and played around with it. "HS" was a guy who went beyond the language and used to play with the class file format and raw JVM instructions - he was promptly labelled a "weirdo" and people used to make fun of him behind his back, but were still in awe of him.   I am such a weirdo myself now. <tt>:-)</tt> But seriously, the JVM architecture is quite simple and the instruction set is quite high-level and simple - no decent Java programmer will have much difficulty in understanding it. It is worth a <i>dekko</i>.

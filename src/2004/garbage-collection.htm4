Tom quotes Stephan T. Lavavej:<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2004-04/msg00255.html">"Garbage collection is a morally bankrupt idea"</a>.  In my opinion, most developers seem to naively think that Garbage Collection is bad and expensive. They assert that nothing can beat <tt>malloc( )/free( )</tt> based explicit (or implicit, via destructors invoked on leaving a scope) resource management. In fact, unless it is <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html">a good implementation of <tt>malloc( )/free( )</tt></a>, how can you even be sure that these functions will return in a "reasonable" amount of time, every time? You can have sudden stalls under heavy conditions even with these, just as with a garbage collector.  Many nice articles and eye-openers on Garbage Collection can be found at Hans Boehm's site. This article is particularly relevant.

This week Anusha and I played Uru: Ages Beyond Myst - the ambitious and
open-ended 3D incarnation of the Myst series of games.

We have finished the original
single player game and will soon start on The Path of the Shell, which is the
expansion pack for this game.

I liked the game on the whole but just <i>hated</i> some of the elements -
notably the extremely awkward third-person perspective and the associated
movement of the avatar as well as the camera (first-person perspective is
also provided but is difficult to use in many a puzzle). Some of the
puzzles were also quite bad and extremely illogical. I do not
think this game can be finished without the help of a walkthrough.
The graphics, while really stunning at times, do not hold a candle
to the really gorgeous and polished Riven and Exile in the same series. The
story was non-existent and we had no idea why we were carrying out
the whims of the eccentric Yeesha, Atrus's daughter. More irritatingly,
the game engine has a few bugs that make it freeze hard in the middle
of a session and Windows 98 dutifully corrupts a few files every time we
hard-reboot the computer! After some time some of the game files were so
corrupted that we had to uninstall and then reinstall the game to
be able to proceed!
<p>
I hope the forthcoming <a href="http://www.mystrevelation.com/">Myst
Revelation</a> redeems this otherwise quite wonderful
series and Uru remains a forgettable aberration. The playable demo
features gorgeous graphics quite seamlessly integrated with animation
and a great interface.
